# MANO
A pytorch Implementation of MANO hand model

# Description

This is a pytorch implementation of [MANO](https://mano.is.tue.mpg.de/) hand model loader. The code is based on [smplx](https://github.com/vchoutas/smplx) package by [Vassilis Choutas](https://ps.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/vchoutas).

MANO is a differentiable hand model that can map hand pose parameters (joint angles and root location) and shape parameters into a 3D hand mesh. The model is very realistic, has low-dimensions, and can fit any human hand.

This repo was developed to be used in the [GrabNet](https://github.com/otaheri/GrabNet) model to generate realistic hand grasps for unseen 3D objects.

### Requirements
  * [Pytorch>=1.1.0](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) 
  
### Installation
If Pytorch is not installed run the following code for cpu version:
```
pip install torch==1.5.1+cpu torchvision==0.6.1+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```
or install the right PyTorch GPU version.

```
pip install git+'https://github.com/otaheri/MANO'

```

### Downloading models

Inorder to download hand models:
* please register at the [MANO](https://mano.is.tue.mpg.de/) website and download the models.
* put the models in a folder with the folowing structure
```bash
models
|
└── mano
    ├── MANO_RIGHT.pkl
    └── MANO_LEFT.pkl

```

### Examples

```python

import torch
import mano
from mano.utils import Mesh

model_path = 'PATH_TO_MANO_MODELS'
n_comps = 45
batch_size = 10

rh_model = mano.load(model_path=model_path,
                     is_right= True,
                     num_pca_comps=n_comps,
                     batch_size=batch_size,
                     flat_hand_mean=False)

betas = torch.rand(batch_size, 10)*.1
pose = torch.rand(batch_size, n_comps)*.1
global_orient = torch.rand(batch_size, 3)
transl        = torch.rand(batch_size, 3)

output = rh_model(betas=betas,
                  global_orient=global_orient,
                  hand_pose=pose,
                  transl=transl,
                  return_verts=True,
                  return_tips = True)


h_meshes = rh_model.hand_meshes(output)
j_meshes = rh_model.joint_meshes(output)

#visualize hand mesh only
h_meshes[0].show()

#visualize joints mesh only
j_meshes[0].show()

#visualize hand and joint meshes
hj_meshes = Mesh.concatenate_meshes([h_meshes[0], j_meshes[0]])
hj_meshes.show() 

```
