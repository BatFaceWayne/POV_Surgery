# Grasp Refinement Module
 To use the grasp refinement module, you need to firstly run the grasp generation module to generate the initial grasps.
## Usage
### Firstly, go to the grasp_refinement folder:
```Shell
cd grasp_refinement
```
### Key Pose Generation
You need to change the input 'generate.mat' file accordingly. The 'generate.mat' file is generated by the grasp generation module.
Also, you should check the dependencies path as mano. You get the refined samples in the 'refined_subsamples' folder.
```Shell
python keypose_refinement.py
```
### Interpolation
The interpolation module is used to generate the intermediate grasps between the key poses. You need to change the input 'generate.mat' the same as the one used in key pose refinement. The usage of this module is very similar to the key pose refinement module.
You get the refined samples in the 'refined_subsamples_interp' folder.
```Shell
python interpolate_between.py
```
