[GrabNet](http://grab.is.tue.mpg.de) is a generative model for 3D hand grasps. Given a 3D object mesh, GrabNet 
can predict several hand grasps for it. GrabNet has two succesive models, CoarseNet (cVAE) and RefineNet.
It is trained on a subset (right hand and object only) of [GRAB](http://grab.is.tue.mpg.de) dataset.
For more details please refer to the [Paper](http://grab.is.tue.mpg.de//uploads/ckeditor/attachments/363/grab_eccv2020.pdf) or the [project website](http://grab.is.tue.mpg.de).

Below you can see some generated results from GrabNet:

## Description

This implementation:

- Can run GrabNet on arbitrary objects provided by users (incl. computing on the fly the BPS representation for them).
- Provides a quick and easy demo on google colab to generate grasps for any given object.
- Can run GrabNet on the test objects of our dataset (with pre-computed object centering and BPS representation).
- Can retrain GrabNet, allowing users to change details in the training configuration.


## Requirements
This package has the following requirements:

* [Pytorch>=1.1.0](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) 
* Python >=3.6.0
* [pytroch3d >=0.2.0](https://pytorch3d.org/) 
* [MANO](https://github.com/otaheri/MANO) 
* [bps_torch](https://github.com/otaheri/bps_torch) 
* [psbody-mesh](https://github.com/MPI-IS/mesh) (for visualization)

## Installation

To install the dependencies please follow the next steps:

- Clone this repository: 
    ```Shell
    git clone https://github.com/otaheri/GrabNet
    ```
- Install the dependencies by the following command:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Getting started

For a quick demo of GrabNet you can give it a try on [google-colab here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1c8OfrHhkwtyb0m75QHO0Dpj1IAgDcaqQ).

Inorder to use the GrabNet model please follow the below steps:


#### CoarseNet and RefineNet models
- Download the GrabNet models from the [GRAB website](https://grab.is.tue.mpg.de), and move the model files to the models folder as described below.
```bash
    GrabNet
        ├── grabnet
        │    │
        │    ├── models
        │    │     └── coarsenet.pt
        │    │     └── refinenet.pt
        │    │     │
```

#### Mano models
- Download MANO models following the steps on the [MANO repo](https://github.com/otaheri/GrabNet) (skip this part if you already followed this for [GRAB dataset](https://github.com/otaheri/GRAB)).

#### GrabNet data (only required for retraining the model or testing on the test objects)
- Download the GrabNet dataset (ZIP files) from [this website](http://grab.is.tue.mpg.de). Please do NOT unzip the files yet.
- Put all the downloaded ZIP files for GrabNet in a folder.
- Clone this repository and install the requirements: 
    ```Shell
    git clone https://github.com/otaheri/GrabNet
    ```
- Run the following command to extract the ZIP files.

    ```Shell
    python grabnet/data/unzip_data.py   --data-path $PATH_TO_FOLDER_WITH_ZIP_FILES \
                                        --ectract-path $PATH_TO_EXTRACT_DATASET_TO
    ```
- The extracted data should be in the following structure.
```bash
    GRAB
    ├── data
    │    │
    │    ├── bps.npz
    │    └── obj_info.npy
    │    └── sbj_info.npy
    │    │
    │    └── [split_name] from (test, train, val)
    │          │
    │          └── frame_names.npz
    │          └── grabnet_[split_name].npz
    │          └── data
    │                └── s1
    │                └── ...
    │                └── s10
    └── tools
         │
         ├── object_meshes
         └── subject_meshes
```


## Examples

After installing the *GrabNet* package, dependencies, and downloading the data and the models from
 mano website, you should be able to run the following examples:


- #### Generate several grasps for new unseen objects
    
    ```Shell
    python grabnet/tests/grab_new_objects.py --obj-path $NEW_OBJECT_PATH \
                                             --rhm-path $MANO_MODEL_FOLDER
                                            

- #### Generate grasps for test data and compare to ground truth (GT)
    
    ```Shell
    python grabnet/tests/test.py     --rhm-path $MANO_MODEL_FOLDER \
                                     --data-path $PATH_TO_GRABNET_DATA
    ```

- #### Train GrabNet with new configurations 
    
    To retrain GrabNet with a new configuration, please use the following code.
    
    ```Shell
    python train.py  --work-dir $SAVING_PATH \
                     --rhm-path $MANO_MODEL_FOLDER \
                     --data-path $PATH_TO_GRABNET_DATA
    ```
    
- #### Get the GrabNet evaluation errors on the dataset 
    
    ```Shell
    python eval.py     --rhm-path $MANO_MODEL_FOLDER \
                       --data-path $PATH_TO_GRABNET_DATA
    ```
